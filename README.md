Project Name: Insurance Charges Linear Regression Analysis

Description:
This project uses a linear regression model to analyze the relationship between age and insurance charges. 
By fitting a best fit line, we can better understand how age affects insurance costs and make predictions about potential charges based on a person's age.

- Building a Linear Regression Model
- Making Predictions and Creating a Best Fit Line

Installation:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 and necessary libraries installed (pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn,matplotLib).
3. Run the code from your preferred IDE or command line interface.
4. download insurance.csv

Usage:
1. After installing the project, run the code to read in the dataset and fit a linear regression model.
2. View the scatterplot to visualize the relationship between age and insurance charges.
3. Use the best fit line to make predictions about potential charges based on a person's age.
